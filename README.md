# Newsletter
A newsletter for the API specification community, driven using this GitHub repository.

The current outline:

- Specification Highlight - Highlight part of one specification.
- Provider Highlight - Demonstrate one API provider using specification.
- Service Provider Showcase - Showcase one service provider.
- Open Source Tool - Showcase one open source tool.
- Questions - A couple of the answered questions.
- Conversation - The latest conversation from the toolbox.

This will be done once a week, and emailed to distribution list -- currently being setup.

We are using the GitHub issues for this repository to build each edition--here are the current ones:

- [API Specification Toolbox Issue 1](https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/newsletter/issues/1)

If you have any other questions or comments feel free to ask by submitting an issue. We will label, organized, and work to address each issues, as well as work to crowdsource the newsletter across the community.
