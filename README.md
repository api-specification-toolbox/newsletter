# Newsletter
This is a API specification toolbox for developing a newsletter for the API specification community, driven using this GitHub repository. We haven't actually published a newsletter yet, but will once we have a couple of issues defined, as well as the end to end process for managing it as a community.

The current outline of a newsletter is as follows:

- **Specification** - Highlight part of one specification.
- **Specification Extension** - Showcasing one extension of a specification.
- **Provider** - Show one aPI provider who is using one of the specifications.
- **Service** - Showcase one service provider who is using one of the specifications.
- **Tools** - Showcase one open source tool that puts specification to work.
- **News** - Five of the interesting news articles from across the specifications.
- **Videos** - One of the interesting videos from the collection of videos.
- **Project** - One of the interesting projects from the list of projects in motion.

This will be done once a week, and emailed to distribution list -- currently being defined and setup.

We are using the GitHub issues for this repository to build each edition--here are the current ones:

- [API Specification Toolbox Issue 1](https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/newsletter/issues/1)

If you have any other questions or comments feel free to ask by submitting an issue. We will label, organized, and work to address each issues, as well as work to crowdsource the newsletter across the community.

This is a community effort so feel free to suggest items for a newsletter issue, or even take the lead on creating one or more issues yourself. We need all the help we can to get this moving!
